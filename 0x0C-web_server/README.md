                       0x0C. Web server


A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with other connected devices, while web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. The web server process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host websites must have web server software.

Web servers are used in web hosting, or the hosting of data for websites and web-based applications -- or web applications.

How do web servers work?
Web server software is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery of the site's content to the requesting user. The software side is also comprised of several components, with at least an HTTP server. The HTTP server is able to understand HTTP and URLs. As hardware, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files.

When a web browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox, needs a file that's hosted on a web server, the browser will request the file by HTTP. When the request is received by the web server, the HTTP server will accept the request, find the content and send it back to the browser through HTTP.

More specifically, when a browser requests a page from a web server, the process will follow a series of steps. First, a person will specify a URL in a web browser's address bar. The web browser will then obtain the IP address of the domain name -- either translating the URL through DNS (Domain Name System) or by searching in its cache. This will bring the browser to a web server. The browser will then request the specific file from the web server by an HTTP request. The web server will respond, sending the browser the requested page, again, through HTTP. If the requested page does not exist or if something goes wrong, the web server will respond with an error message. The browser will then be able to display the webpage.

Multiple domains also can be hosted on one web server.

Examples of web server uses
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs that are used for:

sending and receiving emails;
downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files; and
building and publishing webpages.
Many basic web servers will also support server-side scripting, which is used to employ scripts on a web server that can customize the response to the client. Server-side scripting runs on the server machine and typically has a broad feature set, which includes database access. The server-side scripting process will also use Active Server Pages (ASP), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and other scripting languages. This process also allows HTML documents to be created dynamically.

Dynamic vs. static web servers
A web server can be used to serve either static or dynamic content. Static refers to the content being shown as is, while dynamic content can be updated and changed. A static web server will consist of a computer and HTTP software. It is considered static because the sever will send hosted files as is to a browser.

Dynamic web browsers will consist of a web server and other software such as an application server and database. It is considered dynamic because the application server can be used to update any hosted files before they are sent to a browser. The web server can generate content when it is requested from the database. Though this process is more flexible, it is also more complicated.
