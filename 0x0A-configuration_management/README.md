Puppet is a popular open-source configuration management tool that automates the deployment, configuration, and management of software and systems across a network. With Puppet, you can define the desired state of your infrastructure as code, and Puppet will ensure that all nodes in your infrastructure converge to that desired state.

This section explores the basic usage of puppet.

A Simple Puppet Tutorial
To get started create a new manifest file: Start by creating a new file with the .pp extension. For example, you can create a file called my_manifest.pp in your working directory.

Define a class: In Puppet, you organize your code into classes. A class is a reusable set of code that defines a specific configuration or behavior. To define a class, use the class keyword followed by the name of your class. For example:

class myclass {
  # Code goes here
}
Define resources: Resources are the building blocks of your manifest. They define the desired state of a specific configuration item, such as a file, package, service, or user account. To define a resource, use the resource type followed by the resource title and a block of attributes. For example:
class myclass {
  package { 'apache2':
    ensure => installed,
  }

  file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
    content => 'Hello, World!',
  }
}
